## AWS CLI Installation

Modification to gitpod.yaml to include scripts to run the first time the workspace is established. This includes installing AWS cli and setting up the environment variable to get prompts for aws cli completion.

Update the `.gitpod.yml` with the following task defition.
```sh
tasks:
  - name: aws-cli
    env:
      AWS_CLI_AUTO_PROMPT: on-partial
    init: |
      cd /workspace
      curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
      unzip awscliv2.zip
      sudo ./aws/install
      cd $THEIA_WORKSPACE_ROOT
```

Also added environment variables that are needed in the GITPOD 
```
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=""
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=""
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1
export AWS_REGION=us-east-1
```

Save these environment variable into Gitpod for future workspaces
```
gp env AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=""
gp env AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=""
gp env AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1
gp env AWS_REGION=us-east-1
```
